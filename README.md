## 2D Platformer Game

For my project this term, I would like to design and program a 2D platformer game.
The goal of the game would be similar to Mario, which is to make your character reach
the end of a level without getting hit by enemies.
The basic features of the game will include:

- Left, right, and jumping movement
- Platforms to maneuver through
- ***HAZARDS*** that players must avoid
- Unique **POWER-UPS** to pick up and use
- Saving and loading of game data

Anybody who has played games similar to Mario and anybody who wants to try a fun little 
game in general will be the primary users of this application. While I am not aiming to become
a game developer right now, I have played a lot of games during my spare time,
and I am very eager to try to develop a functional game myself. I would also like 
to make this game as pretty and as fun as possible with the time I have, as I would
like any potential player to have an enjoyable time playing the game I made.
